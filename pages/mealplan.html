                        <p class="diet-p1">Whether you're trying to gain weight, lose weight or simply stay where you're at, you need to control your calorie intake. Gaining weight requires that you eat more calories than you burn while losing weight requires the opposite. Your calorie balance (difference between what you eat and what you burn) will determine your weight, there is no way around it.</p>
                        <p>Whether you're trying to lose weight, gain weight, or stick to your current weight, you might be tempted to look up the suggested calories per day for your gender, age, and activity level. The following chart should only be used as a reference point because every person is so different metabolically even when they are the same size and gender. </p>

                    <h2 class="diet-h2">Calorie Deficit</h2>
                        <p>A calorie deficit is the number of calories you need to eat in a day to lose weight compared to the calories to maintain your weight.  You create a calorie deficit by either eating less calories, burning more calories (through exercise) or a combination of the two.For example, if the amount of calories to maintain your weight is 2000 calories, you need to create a calorie deficit in order to lose weight.  You'd need to eat less than 2000 calories and/or burn extra calories through exercise.When you create a calorie deficit, your body will dig into your fat stores for the extra energy it needs.  When you burn up your fat stores, you lose weight.</p>

                <h2 class="diet-h2">Calorie Surplus</h2>
                    <p>A calorie surplus is a state in which you consume more calories than you burn leading to weight gain in the form of muscle or body fat. While a calorie surplus is required to gain weight, simply eating more only leads to unsightly body fat. To gain muscle, you must combine a calorie surplus with a solid strength training routine.A calorie surplus is a state in which you eat more calories than you burn. If you eat 3,000 calories per day and burn 2,500, you've created a surplus or excess of 500 calories per day. When you create a calorie surplus, your body either uses the extra energy to build muscle or store fat.</p>
