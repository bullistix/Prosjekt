                        <h1 class="head-title-article" >Food you should be eating</h1>
                            <p class="diet-p1">Whether you're trying to gain weight, lose weight or simply stay where you're at,you need to control your calorie intake. If you want to become stronger with some gain of weight, it is required to follow a calorie surpluss diet. If you want to lose weight or get ripped muscles, it is required to follow a calorie defiet diet. On this page you will be guided through an explanation of fitness diet, and will be offered a free diet routine every week! </p>
                            <p>The importance of calorie intake, nutrition and diet knowledge is key, whether you want to become a bodybuilder or a cyclist.  "What does calorie mean" you might wonder, it is the energy our body gains while consuming food and drinks. Calories are the essential key factor for all species on earth, and its importance for our body. There are three states of calorie intake that determine our body, neutral calorie intake, calorie surplus and calorie deficit.</p>
                            <h2 class="diet-h2">Calorie Deficit</h2>
                            <p>Whenever you want to lose fat, it is necessary to create something called "calorie deficit". A state where your daily calorie maintain intake is lowered. This would only be possible by either eating less calories, burning more calories (through exercise) or a combination of both. If the amount of calories to maintain your weight is 1500 calories per day, you need to train/eat in order to get a daily calorie intake of less than 1500. This will force your body to dig into your fat stores for the extra energy it needs and burn up the fat stores. However, if you lower your daily intake with over 500 calories, you will be losing both fat AND muscles, something your body will not like. However, here comes the benefits of following a fitness diet that will be helping you lose as much fat as possible while maintaining a fit body. Following a calorie deficit diet will make your muscles more visible, get rid of stubborn belly fat and make you look good naked!</p>                                                                                                                          
                            <h2 class="diet-h2">Calorie Surplus</h2>
                            <p>A calorie surplus is a state in which you consume more calories than you burn leading to weight gain in the form of muscle or body fat. While a calorie surplus is required to gain weight, simply eating more only leads to unhealthy body fat. In order to gain muscle while gaining little to no fat, you must combine strength training with a calorie surplus diet. The addition calories you end up with, will be used to build muscle and store fat. It is not possible to build pure muscles without gaining fat, however, by following a surplus diet, it will help you gain a higher ratio of muscles.</p>                            
                            <h2 class="diet-h2">Avoid</h2>
                            <p>What you should be avoiding while following a diet, are food/drinks that gives you poor nutrition balance, containing high level of calories from sugar and fat with a lack of healthy contributes. Other related habits such as smoking, lack of sleep and dehydration are some examples of ways to minimize the effects of a fitness diet. In order to reach a goal, it is highly beneficial to throw away such unhealthy habits while following a fitness goal.</p><br>
                            <p>Below you will see some examples of food listed as surplus or deficit, food with low fats and calories fits into the deficit list, while food containing healthy calories and fats are listed as surplus. the avoid list simply shows what you should be avoid while being in a diet. </p>
