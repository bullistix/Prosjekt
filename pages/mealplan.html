                            <p class="diet-p1">Whether you're trying to gain weight, lose weight or simply stay where you're at,you need to control your calorie intake. If you want to become stronger with some gain of weight, it is required to follow a calorie surpluss diet. If you want to lose weight or get ripped muscles, it is required to follow a calorie defiet diet.</p>
                            <p>Depending on your fitness goal, training routine and eating habits, you might be tempted to look up the suggested diet per week for your gender, age, and activity level. Down below you will see what food you should be eating and what not, depending if you are trying to lose weight or gain weight. </p>
                            <h2 class="diet-h2">Calorie Deficit</h2>
                            <p>A calorie deficit is the number of calories you need to eat in a day to lose weight compared to the calories to maintain your weight.  You create a calorie deficit by either eating less calories, burning more calories (through exercise) or a combination of the two.For example, if the amount of calories to maintain your weight is 2000 calories, you need to create a calorie deficit in order to lose weight.  You'd need to eat less than 2000 calories and/or burn extra calories through exercise.When you create a calorie deficit, your body will dig into your fat stores for the extra energy it needs.  When you burn up your fat stores, you lose weight. This will make your muscles more visible, but it wont increase muscle size/fibers.</p>
                            <h2 class="diet-h2">Calorie Surplus</h2>
                            <p>A calorie surplus is a state in which you consume more calories than you burn leading to weight gain in the form of muscle or body fat. While a calorie surplus is required to gain weight, simply eating more only leads to unsightly body fat. To gain muscle, you must combine a calorie surplus with a solid strength training routine.A calorie surplus is a state in which you eat more calories than you burn. If you eat 3,000 calories per day and burn 2,500, you've created a surplus or excess of 500 calories per day. When you create a calorie surplus, your body either uses the extra energy to build muscle or store fat. Increasing the muscle fiber and size, wont gurantee muscle visablity but it will make you stronger. </p>
